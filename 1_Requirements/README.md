# Introduction

This is a game you can play in a terminal where you catach a ball with a bat. I made use of libraries like <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <conio.h> and <Windows.h>. Windows.h was used to access the Win32 API functions as it makes it easier for the user to use the in-built functionality. I have also made good use of several concepts that i learned in the Genesis programme. 

# Objective
- The only objective here is to catch the ball using the bat
# Features
- Easy to play
- Easy to understand
- Easy to win :)
- Retro feel

**Upcoming features**
- Making the ball move to random  places on the screen
- Introducing lifes and a point system
- Introducing a or several "evil" balls that can cause damage to the player
- Inclusion of retro music
- and much more

# Research
Making these silly games is always fun. For this prroject i had to research about how to use Windows.h library to learn how to take arrow keys as an input in C programming language. Wikipedia and several other open source documentation has been a huge help.

# Requirements to run the game
- Any Windows or Linux machine will suffice.
- If running in a Linux machine, install Wine as <Windows.h> is a windows only library :)
